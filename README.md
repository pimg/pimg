# About me
A driven specialist with a career focussing on interoperability of information exchange through API's. 
With a strong interest for cryptography, API security and development of robust architectures with modern technologies.
Helping organizations with designing and implementing safe and scalable solutions, both on-premise and in the cloud.

With a background in traditional systems integration and BPM domains, I understand architectural concepts like loose coupling, bounded contexts and distributed systems.
Making use of cryptography standards like TLS, JWT and PKI and working with advanced authentication and authorization schemes based on OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
My knowledge of cryptography allows me to ensure safe communication channels and data protection.

I have extensive experience with Golang, using the language to build efficient scalable applications requiring high security levels.
Next to this I also have extensive experience with various API Management platforms and Gateways like Apache APISIX, Kong and Red Hat 3Scale. Including, creating custom extensions for these platforms in LUA.
Secondary I have gained a decade of experience with containerization using Docker and Kubernetes.

Through my knowledge of industry standards (like x.509, OAuth2, JWT, and JWS) and the ability to integrate cutting-edge technologies I can deliver solutions that are both robust, safe and future proof.
